# You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports.
# For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.
# alison heck => Alison Heck

# Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

# Input Format
# A single line of input containing the full name, S.

# Constraints
# The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.
# Note: in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.

# Output Format
# Print the capitalized string, S.

# Sample Input
# chris alan

# Sample Output
# Chris Alan
